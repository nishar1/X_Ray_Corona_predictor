# X_Ray_Corona_predictor
This project is based on the Deep Learning concept of Transfer Learning .
In This project I have used various concept including Transfer Learning And also Adam Optimizer for the desired output.
There are two dataset one contains images of Covid 19 Patients and other contains the images of the Normal Patients .
Thus the pretarined vgg16 Layer is used for to increase the accuracy of the model helping output.
The other droupout and flattening layers are also added .
In the end and random image input is given in the  model which is a xray image of lungs thus the model will predict the outcome whether patient is corona positive or not. 
Loss function value  is 1.8% Prediction accuray is 97%.
